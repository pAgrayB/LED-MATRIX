# LED-Matrix
This repository serves to document the design of an 8x8 matrix of LEDs controlled by an Arduino Nano.

# Design Methodology
The design was the first conceived of and seemed suitable to learn something new. Other quicker designs that include already-made LED matrices and an LED-MATRIX driver did not give extensive soldering practice.
